## Problem Statement

India faces a critical food paradox: 40% of food is wasted annually, while 190 million people go hungry every day. This issue is caused by inefficient agriculture, fragmented supply chains, and the absence of real-time tools for managing surplus.

### Key Challenges

1. **Food Wastage:**

   - 68 million tons of food wasted annually, enough to feed 100 million people.
   - Nearly 40% of food is lost before reaching consumers, including significant waste from restaurants, buffets, and retailers.

2. **Hunger and Malnutrition:**

   - India ranks 94th on the Global Hunger Index.
   - 190 million Indians go hungry daily; 1 in 4 children suffers from malnutrition.

3. **Economic Loss:**

   - ‚Çπ2 lakh crore (1.5% of GDP) lost annually due to food waste.

4. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Food waste accounts for 6% of India‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Clone and Run FeedForward

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/feedforward.git
   ```

   Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd feedforward
   ```

#### 2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   Install the required dependencies for the frontend part of the project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

#### 3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   You should be able to view and interact with the frontend of the app in your browser.

---

#### 4. **Setup the Backend Server**
   Now, go to the backend directory, which is located in the root directory of the project (assuming there's a folder named `server`).

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

#### 5. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   Install the required dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs all the necessary backend dependencies, like Express.js, PostgreSQL, etc.

#### 6. **Start the Backend Server**
   After installing the dependencies, you can start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or whatever your backend configuration is.

---

#### 7. **Keep the Servers Running During Development**
   You will need to keep both the frontend and backend servers running for the application to function properly. To ensure that your servers run continuously, you can use the following methods:

   - **For Frontend Server**: If you are using `npm run dev`, the frontend server will keep running in the terminal window where you executed the command. Just make sure that terminal window is open and running.
   
   - **For Backend Server**: You can use tools like `nodemon` to automatically restart the backend server whenever you make code changes.

   **Install `nodemon` globally (if not installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

   Then, instead of using `npm start`, use:

   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

   This will ensure that the backend server restarts automatically whenever you modify files in the server directory.

---

#### 8. **Restarting the Servers (if needed)**
   If you need to manually restart either server during development:

   - **Frontend Server**: Simply stop the frontend server (`Ctrl + C`) and restart with:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - **Backend Server**: If using `nodemon`, it will automatically restart when file changes are detected. If not, manually stop it (`Ctrl + C`) and run:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

---

### Additional Tips:
- **Database Setup**: Ensure that your PostgreSQL database is set up and properly configured. You may need to run migrations or seed data, depending on your setup.
  
- **Environment Variables**: Check if there are any `.env` files in the root or server directories, and make sure they are correctly configured for both frontend and backend services.

- **Error Handling**: Always check the terminal for any errors after running the servers, and make sure the necessary services (like the database) are running.

---

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can freely interact with FeedForward locally, test features, and make any necessary changes for development.

2. **Advanced Analytics**: Deep insights into surplus trends and recipient needs.
